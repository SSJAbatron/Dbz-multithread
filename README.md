# Dbz-multithread
You have two threads named Goku and Vegeta and their priorities are set the same  as they are even. The code will select attacks randomly and assign to the character and whoever reaches 0 is the loser. This is simulation kinda game. Done using Java
Just compile and run the code it will simulate an output !!!!
Enjoy Goku Vs Vegeta
